## Machine Learning in Neural Networks

This project involves using Neural Networks to see how accurate the predictions for a dataset can be. The beginning of the code involves cleaning up the data by dropping columns and fitting the data to the right parameters. After that neural layers are added and experimented with through trial and error to determine the best outcome. For one example more layers are added and another example more nodes are added, etc.

This project is a simulation of a real life example of using neural networks to build a machine that can take a dataset to produce the most accurate results.
